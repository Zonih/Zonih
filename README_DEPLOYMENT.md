# REFNOS Deployment
Hello, in this project we have deployed 70 nodes in a densely populated city in Costa Rica. To achieve this, we followed the steps outlined below:

#### Before the fieldwork

1. Use Google Earth to identify potential deployment locations.

2. Mark each selected location to obtain its coordinates.

3. Once all desired points are selected, input their coordinates into Google Maps for easier navigation.

4. Prepare each node with the desired Smart Solo script (If you are unsure how to create one, please refer to **README_NODES_PROSPECT**.)

5. Charge all batteries.

6. Securely screw in the nodes.

7. Prepare all necessary _**Deployment Sheets**_ e.g.<img width="717" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-03 at 2 56 47â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dc63e16-a0dd-4fa3-93a3-e8e72168b152" />

8. Gather the required _**Field Equipment**_, including:
    - Node magnets
    - GPS devices
    - Compasses
    - Shovels
    - Sand (to ensure proper coupling between the ground and the node)
    - Wrench
    - Gloves
    - Plastic bags (to protect the nodes from moisture and debris)

#### During the fieldwork

1. Drive to the identified potential site.

2. If necessary, ask for permission to deploy the node. If permission is denied, locate a nearby alternative site and repeat the request.

3. Dig a hole deep enough to fully cover the node.

4. Complete all required fields in the Deployment Sheet.

5. Place the node inside 2 plastic bags for protection and install it in the hole.

6. Ensure the node is properly oriented and leveled.

7. Turn on the node and wait for the green flashing light to confirm it is functioning correctly.

8. Cover the node with sand and the remaining soil.

9. Take photos of the deployment site and hole location for future reference.

10. Record the photo codes in the Deployment Sheet.

11. Proceed to the next potential site and repeat the process.

#### After the fieldwork

1. Update Google Earth and Google Maps with the exact coordinates of each deployed node.

2. Digitize all handwritten information from the Deployment Sheets into a Google Drive spreadsheet.

3. Upload the photos to their respective folders, organized by site.
